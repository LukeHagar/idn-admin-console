<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The IdentityNow Admin Console is a tool developed and maintained by the SailPoint Developer Relations team. It is a desktop application that allows you to administer and troubleshoot IdentityNow. It is built using Electron and Sveltekit. 

The goal of this tool is to provide a single place to perform common administrative tasks and to troubleshoot issues in your IdentityNow tenant.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To use this tool, you will need to have an IdentityNow tenant. 

### Using a release

Built versions of this application should be available for each major OS platform. You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/idn-admin-console/releases/latest). 

Simply pick your OS and download the relevant file from the latest release:
| Platform | File Type |
| -------- | --------- |
| Windows  | exe, zip  |
| Mac      | dmg, zip  |
| Linux    | deb, rpm, zip |

If you would like to build the application yourself, you can do so by following these steps:

### Building the Application from Source

Prerequisites:
* To build the application from source you will need NPM installed. You can find instructions on how to install NPM [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Once you have NPM installed, you can clone this repository and run the following commands in the specified order and folders:

In the folder: `./Sveltekit-App`
First run
```bash
npm install
```

Then run
```bash
npm run build
```

Next in the folder: `./Electron-App`
First run
```bash
npm install
```

Then run
```bash
npm run build
```

Assuming no errors occurred during the build process, the built application binaries should then be located in the `./Electron-App/out` folder.
